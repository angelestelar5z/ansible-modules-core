module: set_fact
short_description: Set host facts from a task
description:
     - This module allows you to set host facts from a task. This can be
       useful for setting facts conditionally or allows to 'export' play
       variables set by 'vars:' or 'vars_files:' to the playbook scope .
     - In comparison to variables defined in the playbook, global variables
       can be set conditionally (like any module) and are available in other
       plays.
options:
  key_value:
    description:
      - The C(set_fact) module takes key=value pairs as variables to set
        in the playbook scope. Or alternatively, accepts complex arguments
        using the C(args:) statement.
    required: true
    default: null
version_added: "1.2"
examples:
    - description: "Example setting host facts using key=value pairs"
      code: |
            action: set_fact fact="something" global_fact="${local_var}"'
    - description: "Example setting host facts using complex arguments"
      code: |
            action: set_fact
            args:
              fact: something
              global_fact: ${local_var}
notes:
    - You can set play variables using the C(set_var) module.
