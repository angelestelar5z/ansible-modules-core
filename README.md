ansible-modules-core
====================

This repo is transitional and not yet enabled.  Do not send issues or pull requests here yet.

The goal is to split library/ from ansible into git submodules. 

See details:  https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ansible-devel/W2FYdXZ7zlM

Once complete, core modules will be manually promoted from new submissions to extras.  New modules must be submitted first to extras, and tickets should be opened in the appropriate repo (ansible/ansible, ansible/ansible-modules-core, or ansible/ansible-modules-extras).
